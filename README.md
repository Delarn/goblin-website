goblin-website
==============

Repository for goblin's official website.

This is a work in progress, and you're help would be amazing!

##How to Run
1. Clone the repository to a folder (or download it).
2. Navigate to it on the command line.
3. Run 'node .' (or 'nodejs .' if on Ubuntu Linux)
4. Visit localhost:8000 in your browser and you'll see the website running!

##Version
This website runs on Goblin v0.0.2

##Database
I have publically connect this to an official instance on IrisCouch -- goblin.iriscouch.com -- and have included
the credientials in the repository.

Of course, you can switch this out, and when it's in production, I will be changing this (it may also get crazy with more contributors!) but I thought the excitement of getting goblin up in running on your computer in 4 steps and no DB setup would be worth it, at least for now!
